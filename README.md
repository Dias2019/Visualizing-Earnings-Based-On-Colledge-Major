# Visualizing-Earnings-Based-On-Colledge-Major
In this project, we will be working with a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. Each row in the dataset represents a different major in college and contains information on gender diversity, employment rates, median salaries, and more.<br/>  
The original data on job outcomes was released by American Community Survey, which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the dataset and released it on their Github repo.<br/>  
By using data visualization techniques, we can start to explore questions from the dataset like:
1. Do students in more popular majors make more money?
2. How many majors are predominantly male? Predominantly female?
3. Which category of majors have the most students?<br/>
and many more...

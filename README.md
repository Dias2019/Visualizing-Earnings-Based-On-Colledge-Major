# Visualizing-Earnings-Based-On-Colledge-Major
In this project, we will be working with a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. Each row in the dataset represents a different major in college and contains information on gender diversity, employment rates, median salaries, and more.
